# Week 1:  hello world. 2025

_Caveat: Don't treat these as "proper" examples.  I'm just showing what I did to get up to speed with the homebrew environment.  Look at these, learn and avoid the same bruises_

## TODO 
Just set up the environment and change the ProgrammingOnTheWiiU example a bit.
Get used the Makefile.
Load the rpx via wiiload or cemu.

```
$ make
$ export WIILOAD=tcp:192.168.0.2
$ wiiload *.rpx
```
